### Description

This is a custom implementation of the printf function in C, which allows you to format and print data to the standard output stream. The function supports various conversion specifiers, including `%c` for characters, `%s` for strings, and `%%` for printing a percent sign.

2. Include the `main.h` header file in your C code.
3. Compile your C program with the `_printf.c` file using the appropriate compiler flags.

```c
#include "main.h"

int main(void) {
    // Your code here
    return (0);
}

## Usage
To print data using the custom printf function, you can use the same syntax as the standard printf function:

_printf("Hello, %s! The value is %d.\n", "User", 42);
This will print:
Hello, User! The value is 42.
Supported Format Specifiers
The custom printf function supports the following format specifiers:

%c: Print a single character.
%s: Print a string.
%%: Print a percent sign.
%d, %i: Print a signed integer.
Note: At the moment, the function does not support all features of the standard printf function, such as flags, field width, precision, and length modifiers.
